     * If the "-g" option was given on the command line, we want to continue  *
     * to search for additional matches in the subject string, in a similar   *
     * way to the /g option in Perl. This turns out to be trickier than you   *
     * might think because of the possibility of matching an empty string.    *
     * What happens is as follows:                                            *
     *                                                                        *
     * If the previous match was NOT for an empty string, we can just start   *
     * the next match at the end of the previous one.                         *
     *                                                                        *
     * If the previous match WAS for an empty string, we can't do that, as it *
     * would lead to an infinite loop. Instead, a special call of pcre_exec() *
     * is made with the PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE_ANCHORED flags set.    *
     * The first of these tells PCRE that an empty string at the start of the *
     * subject is not a valid match; other possibilities must be tried. The   *
     * second flag restricts PCRE to one match attempt at the initial string  *
     * position. If this match succeeds, an alternative to the empty string   *
     * match has been found, and we can print it and proceed round the loop,  *
     * advancing by the length of whatever was found. If this match does not  *
     * succeed, we still stay in the loop, advancing by just one character.   *
     * In UTF-8 mode, which can be set by (*UTF8) in the pattern, this may be *
     * more than one byte.                                                    *

     * However, there is a complication concerned with newlines. When the     *
     * newline convention is such that CRLF is a valid newline, we must       *
     * advance by two characters rather than one. The newline convention can  *
